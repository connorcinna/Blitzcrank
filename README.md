this is my first discord bot. a list of commands can be found in the Commands folder, but in short:
!meme will choose a random meme image from a growing collection of images hosted locally by me
!playnext will choose a random steam game for you to play next on the steam store (not a game that you own)
!search will search google for whatever argument you give it and return the first image result
the commands with names, i.e. !armin or !ethan will send a message saying "*name* is *adjective* from a list of 1346 adjectives.
